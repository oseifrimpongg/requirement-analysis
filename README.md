# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## ALx ProDev Frontend Requirement Analysis Project

This repository is part of a project focused on mastering requirement analysis for a booking management system. It simulates a real-world scenario to help define, document, and structure software requirements, covering both functional and non-functional aspects. The goal is to build a solid foundation for development through clear documentation, use cases, diagrams, and acceptance criteria aligned with industry standards.
