# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## ALx ProDev Frontend Requirement Analysis Project

This repository is part of a project focused on mastering requirement analysis for a booking management system. It simulates a real-world scenario to help define, document, and structure software requirements, covering both functional and non-functional aspects. The goal is to build a solid foundation for development through clear documentation, use cases, diagrams, and acceptance criteria aligned with industry standards.

Perfect. Based on your notes and task descriptions, here’s a clean and concise write-up for tasks 2 through 7. I've left space for the parts you need to do yourself.

### What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) focused on identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It ensures that developers and clients have a shared understanding of what the system should do, minimizing ambiguity and misalignment. This phase lays the groundwork for successful design, development, and deployment.

1. **Clear Project Scope and Objectives**
   It helps define what the software should and shouldn't do, keeping everyone aligned and avoiding unnecessary features or scope creep.

2. **Improved Stakeholder Satisfaction**
   Capturing the actual needs of users and clients early ensures the final product matches expectations, reducing revisions and complaints later.

3. **Reduced Development Costs and Time**
   Well-defined requirements minimize rework, miscommunication, and delays, saving both money and time throughout the development cycle.

4. **Enhanced Quality of the Final Product**
   Clear requirements allow for better design, more focused testing, and ultimately, a more reliable and user-friendly system.

5. **Better Risk Management**
   Identifying potential pitfalls and mismatched expectations early helps avoid major setbacks during development or deployment.

### Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

* **Requirement Gathering**
  Involves collecting information from stakeholders, users, and subject matter experts to understand what the system needs to accomplish.

* **Requirement Elicitation**
  Focuses on actively engaging stakeholders using techniques like interviews, workshops, and brainstorming to uncover explicit and hidden requirements.

* **Requirement Documentation**
  Translates gathered data into clear, structured formats such as requirement specifications, user stories, and use case descriptions.

* **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**
  Breaks down and organizes requirements using tools like Data Flow Diagrams, User Stories, and models to visualize system behavior and relationships.

* **Requirement Validation**
  Ensures all documented requirements are complete, feasible, and aligned with business goals, often involving reviews, walkthroughs, or prototyping.

### Types of Requirements

#### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements define what the system should do—specific features, behaviors, and interactions.

**Examples for the AirBNB Clone Project:**

* Users can search for available hotels using location, price, and date filters.
* Hotel managers can update room availability and pricing via their portal.
* Customers can book rooms and make payments through an integrated payment service.
* Notifications are sent to users and managers upon successful bookings.
* Users can view current and past bookings in the "My Bookings" section.

#### Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements describe how the system performs and behaves under certain conditions.

**Examples for the AirBNB Clone Project:**

* The system must handle high user traffic without performance degradation (scalability).
* Average response time for search queries should be under 2 seconds (performance).
* All user data must be encrypted during transit and at rest (security).
* The service must maintain 99.9% uptime throughout the year (availability).
* The system should be able to handle over 10,000 concurrent users (reliability & scalability).

### Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria are predefined conditions that a software feature must satisfy to be considered complete and acceptable by stakeholders. They ensure that everyone—developers, testers, and clients—shares a common understanding of what a successful feature implementation looks like. Well-defined criteria reduce ambiguity, guide development, and serve as the basis for testing and validation.

#### Example – Checkout Feature

**Feature**: Complete hotel room booking (Checkout)

**Acceptance Criteria**:

* The user must be able to review their booking summary before proceeding.
* The system must validate availability and pricing in real-time before final confirmation.
* Payment must be processed securely through the integrated payment gateway.
* A confirmation message and email must be sent after successful payment.
* The booking details must be stored and immediately visible in the user's booking history.
