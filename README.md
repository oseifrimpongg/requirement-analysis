# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## ALx ProDev Frontend Requirement Analysis Project

This repository is part of a project focused on mastering requirement analysis for a booking management system. It simulates a real-world scenario to help define, document, and structure software requirements, covering both functional and non-functional aspects. The goal is to build a solid foundation for development through clear documentation, use cases, diagrams, and acceptance criteria aligned with industry standards.

Perfect. Based on your notes and task descriptions, hereâ€™s a clean and concise write-up for tasks 2 through 7. I've left space for the parts you need to do yourself.

### What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) focused on identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It ensures that developers and clients have a shared understanding of what the system should do, minimizing ambiguity and misalignment. This phase lays the groundwork for successful design, development, and deployment.
